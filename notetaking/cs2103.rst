Software development cycles / Process models

The sequential/waterfall model is as follows:

1. Specify requirements
2. Design product
3. Implement
4. Test
5. Deploy

There is also an iterative approach, divided into iterations instead of
phases:

1. Development
2. Get feedback

Problem with waterfall approach, difficult to determine time taken
for each phase.
But there are also downsides to iterative approach, i.e. overhead from
redesigning features, unclear progress towards end product.

Waterfall is used if requirements are well-understood, fixed and predictable.
Iterative for fuzzy and evolving requirements.

iP = iterative, breadth-first
